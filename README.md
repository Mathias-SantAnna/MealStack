  - Recipe list with options to **add, edit, delete, and view details**.
  - **Search functionality** for instant filtering.

### 🖥️ Backend:
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core MVC (C#)
- **API Endpoints (RESTful CRUD Operations):**
  - `POST /Recipes` → Add a new recipe.
  - `GET /Recipes` → Retrieve all recipes.
  - `GET /Recipes/{id}` → Get details of a specific recipe.
  - `PUT /Recipes/{id}` → Update an existing recipe.
  - `DELETE /Recipes/{id}` → Remove a recipe.

### 🗄️ Database:

  tags        - Optional tags (e.g., "Dessert", "Vegetarian").
  ```

## 🌎 Technical Aspects of MealStack
MealStack follows a client-server architecture implemented with ASP.NET Core MVC. The system follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which ensures scalability and maintainability.

- **Model:** Represents the recipe data, user profiles, and meal planning entities.
- **View:** Dynamically renders HTML pages or serves JSON responses for frontend frameworks.
- **Controller:** Handles user requests, processes input, and coordinates between views and models.

### Implementation Technologies and Platforms:
- **Programming Languages:**
  - C# (backend using ASP.NET Core MVC)
  - JavaScript (frontend with optional React integration)
- **Frameworks & Tools:**
  - ASP.NET Core MVC (web application framework)
  - Entity Framework Core (ORM for database interactions)
  - .NET 8 (runtime and development platform)
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL or SQL Server (accessed via Entity Framework Core)
- **Cloud Platforms:**
  - Azure (ideal for .NET apps), AWS, or Google Cloud Platform

### 🎢 Pros and Cons of Technologies
#### **C# and ASP.NET Core:**
✅ Modern, high-performance, and secure web framework  
✅ Built-in support for dependency injection, middleware, and routing  
✅ Ideal for large-scale or enterprise applications  
❌ More setup and learning curve compared to lightweight frameworks

#### **Entity Framework Core:**
✅ Simplifies data access with LINQ and strongly typed models  
✅ Supports migrations and automatic schema generation  
❌ Less flexible in raw SQL operations for advanced use cases

#### **PostgreSQL / SQL Server:**
✅ Reliable and well-suited for structured recipe and user data  
✅ Supports complex queries and indexing for search functionality  
❌ Requires setup and familiarity with relational database management

## 🔧 Proposed System Architecture
MealStack consists of the following core components:

1. **User Interface:**
  - A responsive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - Optional React integration for dynamic interactions
  - Interacts with controllers through form submissions or AJAX requests

2. **ASP.NET Core MVC Application:**
  - Controllers handle HTTP requests
  - Models represent entities such as recipes and users
  - Views render HTML pages or return JSON for API-driven interactions

3. **Database (via Entity Framework Core):**
  - Stores recipe data, user accounts, tags, and meal plans
  - Supports validation, constraints, and efficient querying

4. **Sample Routing for CRUD Operations:**
  - `GET /Recipes` – Display all recipes
  - `GET /Recipes/Create` – Show form to add a recipe
  - `POST /Recipes/Create` – Add a new recipe
  - `GET /Recipes/Edit/{id}` – Show edit form
  - `POST /Recipes/Edit/{id}` – Update recipe
  - `POST /Recipes/Delete/{id}` – Remove recipe

## 💻 Special Software or Hardware Requirements
MealStack does not require specialized software or hardware beyond a modern web browser or mobile device. It will follow a **mobile-first** design to ensure accessibility across different devices.

## 🎨 User Interface
A clean and responsive web-based interface will provide seamless access to MealStack’s core features:
- Add, edit, delete, and view recipe details
- Favorite or share recipes

- **Meal Planning Tools:** Optional features to plan meals for the week or generate shopping lists.

## 🔒 Additional Considerations
### Security:
- User data is secured via **HTTPS** and **secure authentication mechanisms** (e.g., ASP.NET Identity).
- Authorization policies ensure restricted access to sensitive data.

### Scalability:
- Designed for scalability using **stateless APIs**, making cloud deployment (e.g., Azure App Services) efficient.

### Accessibility:
- The UI will follow **WCAG accessibility standards** to ensure inclusivity for all users.

## 🎉 Conclusion
MealStack has the potential to be a **powerful and user-friendly recipe management tool**. By leveraging **ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and modern frontend technologies**, the application will be well-structured, maintainable, and scalable.

With continuous improvements, MealStack can help users **organize, discover, and share meals** effortlessly, promoting healthier eating habits and reducing food waste.
